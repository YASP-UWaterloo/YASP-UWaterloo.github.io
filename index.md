# Yet Another Science Podcast

Yet Another Science Podcast (YASP) is an upcoming podcast devoted to conversations with scholars containing philosophical, historical, motivational, conceptual, and technical questions relating to their research. 

The goal of the podcast is two-fold: first, to provide an informal medium for researchers to discuss and philosophize about their work. Second, a medium for curious minds of various levels (motivated high school students to professors) to learn about your work from the first-person source.

#### _Season 1 will (tentatively) release Sundays at 8 PM EST starting December 4th, 2022._

#### Head over to the [Speakers](./speakers.html) webpage to see the scheduled list of speakers and topics.

#### To find out more about the people behind the podcast, head over to the [People Involved](./people.html) webpage.
